edoAutoHomeMobile
==============

Background
--------------

This is a graphical App for Apple IOS, Android (but also native MacOSX and Windows) for accessing sensors registered by edoAutoHome Server, developed in Python using Kivy-framework.
Main purpose was initially to get to know how you could use Python for Mobile application development where TCP/JSON would be used for communication between server and client.


Requirements
--------------

* Server running edoAutoHome (a RaspberryPi with sensors and software developed in Python), details how to achieve this found at https://github.com/engdan77/edoautohome
* Client hardware, currently tested on iPhone5 IOS 8.1 and Mac OSX 10.9. But packages been built for Android 4.x and Windows 7 (and later) been built.

Installation

To save some trouble of compiling/packaging from the source properly I've done this for you. So all you have to do is to follow the below instructions.

#### Apple iPhone/iPad device

Since I've not (yet) purchased any license for this app is currently packaged into a 'ad-hoc' mode which means you have to transfer/install it manually to a "jailbroken" device.
1. Assure your IOS-device is jailbroken (google "jailbreaka iphone") that usually comes with Cydia and the package AppSync (but if not, check in Cydia that this packag is installed)

2. On your Mac/Windows install a software that allows you to install .ipa package to your device such as the freeware iFunBox (google "iFunBox"

3. Download edoAutoHomeMobile IOS-package from 

4. From iFunBox: Select your device, User Applications, Install App, select the downloaded package
